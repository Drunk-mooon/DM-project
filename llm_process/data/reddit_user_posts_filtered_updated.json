        "text": " nearly   all drugs work by interacting with receptors this is almost a truism  in the sense that a pharmacologist  one who studies the behaviour of drugs  calls anywhere a drug binds it s receptor  though in general  these binding sites are on specific proteins  and the whole protein gets referred to as the receptor  eg the muopioid receptor is a large protein  that has a binding site for morphine   if you re struggling to picture this  imagine a big blob  with a keyhole in it the binding site is the keyhole  and the receptor is the whole blob  we had to change our terminology because a single protein can have multiple binding sites  so drugs come along  and they bind to the receptor  fit in the keyhole   and the changes the behaviour of the receptor some drugs make the receptor work  which usually means it causes some biochemical reaction to begin inside the cell that the receptor lives on  but other drugs stop the receptor from working some drugs just prevent other drugs from activating the receptor respectively  these are referred to as  agonists   inverse agonists  and  antagonists   generally speaking  it s what happens after the drug interacts with the receptor that decides whether you get tolerance some drugs  particularly agonists  activators  cause the receptor to get less sensitive the two main ways this can happen is by the strength of which the agonist binds to the receptor decreasing  the cell modifies the receptor slightly  or it can happen by the cell literally removing receptors off its surface whether this happens  how fast it happens and how strongly it happens depends on the receptor and the drug some drugreceptors interactions cause this to happen very strongly others do nt  generally speaking  agonists  activators  of a receptor cause it to happen  and antagonists do nt drugs which block enzymes generally do nt cause it either morphine is as agonist while aspirin blocks enzymes we do nt really know how paracetamolacetaminophen works caffeine is an odd one caffeine is not an agonist of much but some it s effects are likely to be caused by certain blocking one receptor  adenosine 2a  which in turn causes more noradrenaline to be released  which then activates adrenoreceptors so there could be a source of tolerance there  honestly  i do nt know any research  off the top of my head  that shows the degree of caffeine tolerance  nor how it occurs i m willing to bet it s not anywhere near as strong as opioid tolerance though  because it does nt matter how much coffee you drink  you will feel one good espresso  and no  i do nt believe you if you say  i drink 20 coffees a day i do nt feel it    hopefully that sorts it out for you if it does nt  reply away ",

        "text": "you certainly can see lasers with the naked eye  it s just very dangerous to look at them directly  because they can damage your retina irreparably  you need to think about the light coming out of a laser like a stream of bullets from a rifle they go completely straight  and once properly focused form a tight beam lasers can be made so that the diameter of the beam does nt change by more than fractions of an inch over miles of distance  just like you can stand off target from a rifle and not be hit by a bullet  you can stand beside a laser and not see the beam the photons have to hit your pupil for you to see the laser  assuming the laser is emitting visible light   normal light sources are like shot guns in comparison  the light flings out in all directions  though again  the can be focused  though not as well generally speaking   but again  you can only see the light if photons from that source hit your pupil and are focused onto your retina  so why can you see a laser when it goes through a mist  well to extend out rifle analogy  this is akin to firing the rifle into a concrete wall  and you get ricochets  which now might hit you anywhere when the laser photons hits the particles of mist they are refracted around  bending this way and that  each little droplet of mist is a little prism  and some of them get bent around until they fly into your eye  and then you can see them this is also why you can see lasers in dusty rooms  the little particles of dust are also prisms   you can change the colour of the laser light by the process of fluorescence here the fluorescent molecule absorbs light at one wavelength  but emits it at a very different wavelength this is not restricted to laser light this is what happens to your tshirt under  black light  aka uv light there are chemicals in the tshirt that absorb the uv light and emit light at a variety of wavelengths  appearing white ",

        "text": "it s a little hard to answer because i do nt know how much you know about electricity and electronics  but we re going to start from the basics  first thing is  you need to understand the concepts of voltage and current in order to understand them  we re going to use the fluid analogy imagine a circuit of tubes  filled with water  and a pump driving the water around and around the pump provides pressure  which drives a flow of liquid against the resistance of the the pipes this is equivalent to a voltage source  providing voltage  to drive current against a resistance big voltages make more current flow against the same resistance or a bigger resistance makes less current flow at the same voltage this gives rise to ohm s law v  ir  voltage  currentresistance  we can continue to extend our analog inductors are like a water wheel in our flow if we initially have our pump stopped  and turn it on  all the pressure will build up behind the water wheel  which will eventually starting to get it turning once the water wheel is turning at the speed that the current would flow if the water wheel was nt there  then the water wheel provides no resistance at all moreover  if we try to stop or pump suddenly  the water wheel will keep spinning  because of its inertia   and try to force water through our tubes  making a massive pressure in the pipe  because the pump is off   this is what inductors do when you turn the voltage on and try to drive current through them  the provide a lot of resistance  but once the current is flowing through them  the provide very little resistance but if you try to stop the current flowing suddenly  they can make massive voltages to attempt to keep the current flowing  how do inductors do this  by producing and storing magnetic fields all conductors produce a magnetic field when current flows down them similarly  a  changing  magnetic field around a conductor produces current inductors are coils of wire designed to take advantage of these facts being made as a coil of wire  each wire s magnetic field interacts with every other wire when you try to start pushing current through  the magnetic fields starts to grow  and it tries to push current in the other direction  which makes it hard to start the current through the inductor however  once the current is stable  the magnetic field no longer changes  and hence it no longer tries to induce current in the opposite direction when you try to stop current flow instantly  the large magnetic field is there and it starts to collapse  change   which then tries to drive the current through the inductor note  the magnetic field is growing to begin with  which induces a current opposing the current flow  the magnetic field is collapsing at the end  which produces current in the direction that it was being driven in the first place  and why do we use them  1  because you can see they behave differently when the current is constant  no resistance  ie the spinning water wheel  no changing magnetic field  to when the current is changing  changing magnetic field produces opposing currents   they are used in filters ie currents behaving at certain frequencies can be gotten rid of by inductors 2  changing voltages the ability for inductors to make big voltages when you try to turn them off rapidly is used to make simple voltage converters you put a low voltage into an inductor  switch it off  then store the large voltage spike you get  and use a diode to stop it leaking away this voltage converter is called a boost converter  and it is very common 3  inductors turn up by accident basically all electromechanical devices  motors  solenoids  relays behave as inductors because they have coils of wire transformers also behave as inductors  though it s less by accident there   so electrical engineers need to know how inductors behave because they can produce nasty effects if you do nt think about it  that effect where if you try to stop the current going through an inductor and it produces big voltages is very real  and will damage things if you do nt protect the circuit against it   so  to sum up inductors are circuit elements that are hard to get current to flow through initially  but try to keep the current flowing there after they work by creating a magnetic field  which stores the energy and tries to induce currents we use them as filters and voltage producers and they also turn up by accident ",

        "text": "season 5b was just consistently incredible and tense i m always on the edge of my seat watching this one and there s so much that happens the ending of confessions when jesse busts into walt s house will always be one of my favorite scenes season 4 is similarly really good and a close second  but i just like 5b is a little better  least favorite is probably 5a i really like 5a and it has a ton of amazing scenes and episodes and it s extremely necessary for the story  so when i say least favorite i m not saying it s bad at all but at times it does feel really sloppy and rushed i never liked the prison shanking montage in particular  i always thought it did nt work and felt less like breaking bad  and more like the walking dead when it s trying to be significant also  something i noticed on rewatching it is just how much the season focuses on the logistics of planning and starting up an underground meth empire it s pretty fascinating but i think part of the reason it feels so rushed at times is because they spend so much time on that ",

consists of a command transmitter system plus custom control  interface and monitoring systems  the system can be configured to operate from a single local site  or with several remote sites it does sound useful  youtube  veterans today  system planning corporation  of which he had been corporate vicepresident  is a hightech  research and manufacturing firm based in arlington  virginia  a major

military  and economic consulting a subsidiary of this firm  tridata corporation  oversaw the investigation of the first  terrorist  attack on the world trade center in 1993  which would have provided vital firsthand knowledge of the security systems and structural blueprints of the world trade center  zakheim has close ties to the israeli government  holding dual israeliamerican citizenship  3   as a member of the council for foreign relations  and founding member of the neocon cult  he coauthored the heritage foundation  s infamous tract   rebuilding america  s defenses  strategy  forces and resources for a new century  published by the american enterprise  s  project for a new american century   in which the bush administration  s entire design for renewed global conquest was laid down  exactly a year prior to 911 it called for  some catastrophic and catalyzing event  like a new pearl harbor  as necessary to foster the frame of mind needed for the american public to support a war in the middle east as a respected and established voice in the intelligence community  his views were eagerly accepted  in 2004  an article entitled the mastermind behind 911  on the  truthseeker  website  4  expressed the view that  considering his access to boeing 767 tankers  remote control flight systems  and his published views in the pnac document  it seems very likely he is in fact a key figure in the alleged terrorist attacks in new york city on september 11  2001 rabbi zakheim had access to things like structural integrity  blueprints and any number of important facets of information about the wtc through his work with tridata corporation in the investigation of the bombing of the wtc in 1993 that he had access to remote control technology through his work at system planning corporation  spc   that he had access to boeing aircraft through a lease deal he brokered while working at the pentagon  and finally  that he was part of a group of politically radical straussian neoconservatives  who  through their association with pnac  called for restructuring of the middle east  in response  the truthseeker was threatened with prosecution by zakheim  s lawyers in 2005 and had to remove the article however  the insightful articles   dov zakheim and the 911 conspiracy  and also  the mastermind behind 911  can still be viewed  5   the planes that purportedly slammed into the towers that morning were supposed to be boeing 767s  and zakheim had contracted and sent a number of these to floridamacdill air force base before the event the flight termination system produced by his spc does somewhat resemble the object visible in photographs under the fuselage of flight 175  just prior to its impact into the south tower  6   this plane is suspected to have been a kc767  the military tanker version of the boeing 767 as the truthseeker observed  the remotecontrol technology whereby those speciallyprepared planes impacted the towers  was probably made and managed by zakheim  s company in addition he has enabled substantial support for israel over the years  thanks to him  israel is awash in f15  s  f16  s  and the latest in offensive and defensive missile systems  sold to israel at a fraction of their value zakheim had a central role in the perpetration of 911   from linked article ",

it was spurofthemoment  i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and did nt do any research or anything i scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area  an iq test has shown me to be in the 999th percentile for iq this is the highest result the test i was given reaches  anything further and they d consider it to be within the margin of error for that test  my mother s boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated virginia tech at the age of 15  i understand physics better than him  and i owe very little of it to him  as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything  just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics he s not particularly successful as an engineer  but i ve met lots of other engineers who are nt as good as me at physics  so i m guessing that s not just a result of him being bad at it  i m also pretty good at engineering i do nt have a degree  and other than physics i do nt have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer  but i have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things for example  i independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were  and i was only seven or eight years old when i started inventing wireless electricity solutions  my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy  admittedly not the best plan   i have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy i ve come across every question of existentialism which i ve seen discussed in smbc or xkcd or reddit or anywhere else  the thoughts have nt been new to me philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me  i ve considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is  psychology  i actually understand better than people with degrees unlike engineering  there s no aspect of psychology which i do nt have a very good understanding of i can debunk many of even sigmund freud s theories  i m a good enough writer that i m writing a book and so far everybody who s read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published and that s not just  like  me and family members  that counts strangers on the internet i ve heard zero negative appraisal of it so far  people have critiqued it  but not insulted it  i do nt know if that will suffice as evidence that i m intelligent i m done with it  though  because i d rather defend my maturity  since it s what you ve spent the most time attacking the following are some examples of my morals and ethical code  i believe firmly that everybody deserves a future if we were to capture hitler at the end of wwii  i would be against executing him in fact  if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he was nt just faking it  i d even support the concept of letting him go free this is essentially because i think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future  and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self s actions  it should nt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment  especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them  i do nt believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices are nt harming others i do nt have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever  short of physically acting out necrophilia  pedophilia  or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but i do nt care what a person s fantasies consist of  as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them   i do nt have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to  or clothes they wear  etc i know that s not really an impressive moral  but it s unfortunately rare  a great many people  especially those my age  are judgmental about these things  i love everyone  even people i hate i wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness rick perry is a vile  piece of shit human being  deserving of zero respect  but i wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible i wish this for everyone  i m pretty much a pacifist i ve taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution  because the guy stopped punching after that the only time i ll fight back is if 1  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2  if i do nt attack  i ll come out worse than the other person will if i do in other words  if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me  i do nt fight back i ve therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious  because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that i m never in a situation where i ll be worse off after a fight if i m not going to get any hospitalizing injuries  i really do nt care  the only exception is if someone is going after my life even then  i ll do the minimum amount of harm to them that i possibly can in protecting myself if someone points a gun at me and i can get out of it without harming them  i d prefer to do that over killing them  i consider myself a feminist i do nt believe in enforced or uniform gender roles  they may happen naturally  but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally as in  the societal pressure for gender roles should really go  even if it ll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord i treat women with the same outlook i treat men  and never participate in the old reddit  women are crazy  circlejerk  because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities i do nt think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who are nt awesome  that does nt mean i look for places to victimize women  i just do nt believe it s fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything s ok when it s really not  and that s a particularly harsh example  because all humans do that   i m kind of tired of citing these examples and i m guessing you re getting tired of reading them  if you ve even made it this far in closing  the people who know me in real life all respect me  as do a great many people in the reddit brony community  where i spend most of my time and where i m pretty known for being helpful around the community a lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times  and i spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was  and that comment was second to the top  so i guess other people agreed  though  granted  it was a pretty lowtraffic post  only about a dozen competing comments   and  uh  i m a pretty good moderator  all that  and i think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish so what do you think  now that you at least slightly know me ",

        "text": "i think season 5 is well done and makes sense visavis the rest of the series  but i personally did nt enjoy it as much because it had fewer light moments and comic relief also  jesse  who could be counted upon in previous seasons to be somewhat of a funny character  totally declined in the last season again  his decline and fall made sense but it was nt as fun to watch also  previous seasons had walt struggling with his own moral decline  and in season 5 he seems to be more of a complete psycho totally makes sense  but it s harder to watch season 5 is also interesting in that the audience is once again put in a strange dilemma of disliking skyler and rooting for walt  especially in the scene where he has the nearaly 10 million dollars in the barrel on the driveway and tells his family they have to run for it  but skyler grandstands and closes this particular window of opportunity the audience may find themselves saying   who does this hypocritical bag of garbage think she is  after all the selfserving things she s done  now she wants to climb on the moral high horse again   her facial expressions and gesticulations during the argument were also  i believe  carefully orchestrated to make the audience hate her and want to slap her  and then question their own priorities because walt himself is a murderous  psychotic monster really effective filmmaking  yet uncomfortable to watch ",

        "text": "i need a satisfying skyrim mage build using an xbox 360 controller on a pc  i ve got a level 90 nord male with all perk trees at 100 i ve got all the black books so i can reconfigure perks at will i have a good gaming pc with an xbox 360 controller my problem right now is that i simply can not find a gratifying mage build and i ve tried more than a few ideas  satisfying is a relative concept for each gamer so let me offer my current frame of reference before you reply below i only describe the major chapters of my skyrim career by build                                           heavyarmor twohanded warrior i started playing on novice mode  during early learning curve  using heavy armor and twohanded build  somewhere around level 10 it got boring easy so i bumped to apprentice until i finished the main quest line  first thing  then bumped up to adept during this build i got to see more than a few of the coup de gras cut scenes  very satisfying my final build was legendary dragonplate with a legendary dragon bone hammer with healthstam regen enchants this is a very easy way to play i could easily rush 2 giants and 2 mammoths with maybe only a single health potion having satisified myself with this build i turned to an assassin build   lightarmor dagger assassin i turned to the dark brotherhood questlines and i donned all the best sneak armor i d collected along the way  wielding two dragonbone daggers  legendary   my sneak was already near to 100  and i went out at night to test drive my newb assassin build by my lakeside house and my very first kill was sneaking a vampire in the open dark of night and i got the 15x dagger backstab cut scene throat slice and i was blown away  absolutely fantastic badass gaming experience  my actual thought was this game just let me assassinate a vampire at night     during this time  i would always grab my two hander to deal with random dragons merely to save on potions because i could put any dragon down in two hits before any serious damage but with the daggers not so easy i easily completed all brotherhood quests and was very satisfied with this build   sneak sniper i decided that i wanted to experience dragon slaying without the twohander so i turned to my dragon bone bow  legendary  and trained archery full 100 and ran all the thieves guild quests and it was insane like shooting drunken comatose ducks in a pond this was the first moment i really felt like i was cheating even though i was not although i usually did need a potion or two  i could put down any random dragon with my bow typical potion sequence was a 55  magic resist and a single full health  i finished all the thieves guild quest lines this way it was great and the cut kill scenes with the flying arrows are very satisfying   zerker dual wield i still did not have lightarmor max d because sneaking is such that you rarely get hit and thus you do nt train in addition  onehanded was not max d because daggers and bows do nt count so i turned my attention to a lightarmor  dragonscale legendary  dual wield dragonbone dagger left hand and dragonbone mace right hand  both legendary   and i started clearing my very bloated quest log and chasing all the shouts and dragonborn content i ca nt say enough about this build  it is bleeping fantastic this is the only build that will let you literally sprint all the way thru any dungeon  or anywhere   i ve got enchanting max d so my dagger has stamina regen and soultrap and the mace has stamina regen and paralyze i can literally rush every target and beat it senseless in 12 seconds  including a legendary dragon  sometimes hardly ever getting hit most of the damage taken is from mages at range for me  zerkersprinting combat on legendary difficulty is a serious adrenaline rush i highly recommend the experience it is the most satisfying of each of the major 4 builds i ve described so far   note  i finished both the werewolf and vampire skill trees just to get the achievement but the gameplay was just a gimmick novelty and no where near as good as any of the 4 builds above   mage build     wtf         so once i decided i could not minmax my zerker build better  i finally turned my attention to a mage build i began by training all the 5 schools to 100 and completing all 5 of the college ritual quests so now i m the archmage with 100 s in all 5 trees and all the black books  and all shouts and powers  and i can not find any build that is even remotely close to satisfying it is not that there are not enough spells or that they do nt do some cool stuff  there are plenty of spells and cool fx   but rather that i simply can not find only 2 spells that i can wield such that i can solo an entire dungeon easily with an xbox 360 controller on a pc  so my question for all of you is to simply ask you to tell me how to enjoy a skyrim mage build using an xbox 360 controller and 2 spells  as far as i know i have every kind of item that can benefit a mage  but i ca nt get thru a dungeon without needing 510 spells and that reduces the skyrim mage experience to a big game of popup menu  not fun in the least   note that it is entirely ok to suggest that this is impossible because if it is then i want to know that it is so i do nt waste any more time i ll go back to my legendary zerker   edit  i failed to mention that i made a cheater ring with 3 million magicka  so spell cost is not an issue but even with this god level cheat  i still can not find a satisfying 2spell mage build and my current assessment is this  the magic system is not playable with only 2 spells this is why physical damage builds have value  because they are   playable   and that playability matters ",

        "text": "it is rather difficult for me not to give an advanced answer to your question the best intuition i can give is the following  suppose the spatial universe had positive curvature  instead of zero curvature  which is a flat universe   the prototypical example of a surface of positive curvature everywhere is a sphere the positive curvature means that the sum of the angles of a triangle is always more than 180 degrees  for instance if a space has positive curvature  it has to curve back in on itself to create that  convex  shape of the sphere so the space ends up having to  close up   which means it ends up being finite  there is a general mathematical theorem that states that any complete  riemannian manifold with positive  boundedbelow curvature must be compact it s not an easy theorem  if the curvature is zero everywhere  then the space can just spread out and does nt have to close in on itself so if it never closes up  it just goes on forever  and the space is infinite   the problem with this intuitive picture is that it s a bit wrong the part about a positive curvature space having to be finite is true the part about a zero curvature space having to be infinite is not true a zero curvature space  can  be infinite  but it can also do some odd things like repeat itself  while maintaining the flatness so this just begs the question why then must a flat universe be infinite     edit    to match the edit below it turns out that if space is flat  and  finite  then it must not be isotropic  which means that it does nt look the same in all directions but that statement is mathematically highly nontrivial  to answer that  i have to resort to some more advanced math    warning   some technical and mathematical language ahead someone else might come along to give a more accessible explanation of why flat   gt  infinite until then  requests for clarification are welcome   in the robertstonwalker cosmology  there are three possibilities for the  constant  spatial curvature  the curvature of hypersurfaces of constant cosmological time   determined by the sign of the curvature  positive  zero  or negative   3spaces of constant zero curvature  ie  a flat universe  come in essentially two types   e   3   which is just euclidean space this is a noncompact manifold   s   1  x s   1  x s   1   or the 3torus this is a periodic  compact manifold in this type of universe  you can head out in some direction and eventually come back to your exact starting point the spatial universe is finite  each of these spaces could  in principle  be the topology of the  spatial  universe but we usually rule out the 3torus either because it is periodic or because it is not simply connected  off the top of my head  i can not think of any feasible experimental way to rule out a nonsimplyconnected universe though     edit    oops  forgot to mention that the 3torus is also not  isotropic   which more or less means that space should look the same in all directions  so all that is left is e   3  if the universe is flat  whence the universe must also be infinite   there are  other  3spaces of constant zero curvature for instance  s   1  x k  where k is a klein bottle however  all other spaces that i did not list above are  nonorientable   which then must necessarily also be nonsimplyconnected   so if we do nt rule out a topology for not being simply connected  we would almost certainly rule it out for not being orientable a nonorientable space seems rather nonphysical  it turns out though that there are other deeper reasons to rule out spacetimes that are not spaceorientable it is believed that all interactions are invariant under simultaneous reversal of charge  parity  and time  cptinvariance    a formal statement of the theorem can be proved under some natural conditions  since weak interactions are not cpinvariant  it follows that in going around a closed curve in spacetime  either the sign of charge  the orientation of spacelike axes  and the orientation of time must all reverse  or none of them reverse  which follows from cptinvariance   hence a spacetime is timeorientable if and only if it is also spaceorientable  the question of spaceorientability then becomes one of timeorientability there are examples of spacetimes that are not timeorientable  but the idea of time nonorientability seems even less natural than that of space nonorientability  interestingly  if a spacetime is not timeorientable  it has a double covering space which  is  timeorientable  a spacetime that is not timeorientable presents the same sort of problems that closed timelike curves present  ie  time travel  because there would be closed curves that reverse the time orientation  and so would be able to reinterpret certain events as having occurred in the reverse order you end up getting the same sort of grandfather paradoxes that you hear about when time travel is brought up so we have  very strong  reasons to believe that our universe is timeorientable  which then means  by cptinvariance  that the universe is also spaceorientable ",
