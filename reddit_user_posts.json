        "text": "first time watcher and missed yesterdays thread so i ll just write my thoughts on episodes 1 and 2  good start to the series i liked sora right off the bat with her kinda spunky attitude and sense of humor plus she s cute as fuck in a bunny costume which counts for something i wan na hear more about why she wants to be a star at this circus like thing and that s good her growth and determination are pretty apparent already but nothing has really set her apart from similar characters to her yet but it s episode 2 so not really complaining there  do nt have much of an opinion on the side characters yet as they have nt been shown much but i think i ll like sarah the dorm supervisor she seems funny also the cop is a huge cockblock i do nt like how almost all of the sides seem to hate her though  it seems kind of odd but understandable to a degree i just think they overdid it but fixed it pretty quick with the two girls realizing they misjudged her i m not sure how i feel about the talking statue man yet he seems out of place at the moment  animation is very good for 2003 i thought it was like a 2007 show when i first saw it it s not quite stand alone complex levels  but very good in its own right music was decent but nothing too special except for one track in episode 2 when she did the golden phoenix move  overall  i m liking it but nothing stand out yet ",

        "text": "if you read a lot of  bestgreatest anime of all time  lists  cowboy bebop will surely be a regular fixture but i m not here to talk about cowboy bebop or how cool spike spiegel is or anything that can be summed up with  see you  space cowboy   i m here to talk about another anime directed by shinichiro wantanabe an anime that is one of the only two anime that i have given a 1010 on myanimelist and my favorite anime of all time i am talking about samurai champloo  what s this about  the story takes place in japan during the edo period the first episode introduces us to the three main characters  a wandering swordsman named mugen  a ronin named jin  and a waitress named fuu the setup is that mugen and jin meet at the tea house where fuu works  and they get into a fight in the process  a magistrate s son is murdered and fuu s tea house is burned to the ground  resulting in mugen and jin being sentenced to death however  the two are saved from death by fuu and episode 1 ends with the setup of the anime  fuu asks mugen and jin to accompany her to find a  samurai who smells of sunflowers   and over the course of 26 episodes  we see their journey  why should you see this  you ever hear of the saying  it s the journey  not the destination   that s one of the best ways i can describe this anime because the fun of watching this anime comes from seeing a japan that is nt like the one from history we have a version of edoera japan that has rap  graffiti taggers  and in mugen  a swordsman that is nt a swordsman that s unlike anything you ve seen before  at least i have nt   not only that  but you get to watch the development of the friendship between the three main characters on what s basically an awesome road trip  but let s talk about what s the strongest asset samurai champloo has going for it  the music this has one of the best scores i have heard in anything ever  not just in anime the soundtrack was headed by the late nujabes  who helps to bring the hip hop feel of samurai champloo to life music has always been one of the high points of any shinichiro wantanabe work  and this is no exception and just like how jazz  blues  science fiction  and film noir mesh together seamlessly in cowboy bebop  we see hip hop and samurai mesh seamlessly here  but do nt just take my word for it  here are some tracks   the opening track   battlecry  by nujabes featuring shing02   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  oobuv9q0ada   the main ending track   shiki no uta   by nujabes featuring minmi   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  mah7clumvhe   the ending track from the final episode   san francisco  by midicronica   https  wwwyoutubecomwatch  v  qghjp1qhi8g  personal note  listening to this while rewatching this solidified samurai champloo as my favorite anime of all time  where can you watch this  samurai champloo can be watched  both subbed and dubbed on hulu   http  wwwhulucomsamuraichamploo   subbed and dubbed on netflix  at the time of me writing this  febuary 16th  2016   and episodes can be bought on itunes  though i ca nt find any information regarding being subbed or dubbed on itunes   samurai champloo is my favorite anime of all time and at the very least i hope you find this to be a great anime and a great title from a great director it s very rare that i come across something that i want to see again and again without getting tired  but this is one of those things so if you want to see a great tale of swordsmen  a great tale of samurai  a great character driven journey  watch something with great music  or any combination of the aforementioned things  check out this anime you ll like what you find  i m martinthedragon  and i thank you for reading ",

        "text": "holy fuck what an ending  amuro and char s duel was intense with both their mechs being destroyed kind of sad that the white base was destroyed i was not expecting char to blow off kycilia s head off this episode i was kind of expecting her to survive a little bit longer and into zeta  however i have two major issues  1  while i enjoyed the idea of newtypes and was a reason why i liked the last few episodes so much  i wish it was nt introduced so late  2  i wish the zabi family would ve been fleshed out more compared to characters like ramba ral  who were much better characterized and showed different sides  the zabi family just came across as onedimensional in fact  with an exception to mirai amp  kai  this issue extends to the white base characters as well  other than that  this was an absolutely amazing series and i ll look forward to watching zeta gundam with you all ",
