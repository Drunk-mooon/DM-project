        "text": "example  so i really like god eater  the description from myanimelist   set in a postapocalyptic japan in the year 2071 the world has been mostly destroyed by mysterious monsters known as the aragami an organization known as fenrir was made to exterminate aragami using god arcs   weapons made from aragami cells those who specialize in exterminating aragami are known as god eaters their god arcs originally could only keep a single form  however a new type has been discovered that can switch between gun and blade form since then  they have been classified newtypes and the previous as oldtypes  oh wow  special monsters that can only be killed by special young adults with special powers now i m sure with enough generalization you boil any anime down to a vague and unoriginal sentence  so what i m asking is for anime that you really enjoyed despite you personally looking at the description and thinking  there is so much originality here it must have been written by someone who s lost their hopes  dreams  imagination  and spirit  edit  also anything with the description  normal guy does normal things until suddenly mysterious hot girl appears ",

        "text": "on today  s episode of gundam  it  s the final showdown between amuro and char  and what a fight  that fight when through so many more phases than i expected first  the fight through space with their robots  shooting each other they destroyed both their mobile suits both the gundam and zeong got absolutely wrecked they continue into the base itself  and both jump out of the mobile suits to start a zero gravity gun fight  which was awesome we cut away from the fight for a while  and when we return they  re suddenly engaged in a sword fight  what   when did that happen  i want to see how they got to that point in the fight but they did the whole stab each other thing in the fight  before the arrival of sayla and the continuing destruction of the base forces them to stop amuro got stabbed right through the arm  and char nearly got stabbed in the head  except for the helmet he always wears all in all  it was a pretty awesome duel i  d say it was a pretty good way to have the long fight between amuro and char come to an end  at least for now  the white base got shot down  and crashed onto the base that was a desperate fight to defend it again  i constantly worried about the crew  s safety especially as they had to resort to handtohand combat to defend the white base thankfully  they were able to escape before the white base got destroyed goodbye  white base  you served the crew well for the entire series  amuro was able to communicate psychically with everyone in order to help them escape and so that he could later escape it was gratifying to see him come out of that base  safe his words to lalah  that he had a home he had to return to before he could go see her again  really resonated with me once again  the white base crew has become a family they care about each other seeing them develop into such close comrades who work so well together was great  char completes his revenge he took a bazooka to kycilia  s face  damn  that is harsh  i  m pretty sure i saw body parts flying around after he shot her but  that takes care of most of the main zabi family just beware of dozle  s wife and daughter widows and little kids are dangerous in this series  i don  t believe char is dead for a second he may have gotten caught in the middle of all those explosions and be missing  but i don  t think they  d kill off a major antagonist offscreen  especially since they gave a lot of detail on the other deaths he  s alive  the war is over i  d like to say the series did an excellent job of showing just how massive the scale of the war was at the end there the gundam  guncannon  guntank  and the white base got destroyed  but the federation still won the war effort was much bigger than a single ship or a couple of mobile suits they were one part of a larger war effort  i did notice that at the end  when it said the war ended  we were now in year 0080 based on what the discussion threads have been saying  i know the war began in january 0079 looks like it lasted about a year  and it managed to destroy half of humanity  at the end it also changed what it called zeon it called it the republic of zeon  instead of the principality of zeon looks like it returned to being a democracy after the deaths of most of the ruling family  gt  discussion question of the day this was a pretty fantastic conclusion to the series i know that the ending was rushed  since the show got canceled and had to end sooner than expected  but this really works as a pretty great ending it concluded the char and amuro fight in a satisfying way  and ended the war i m happy with this ending ",

spoilers  please stop reading here  a this is complicated and is actually a long overarcing thread in the last book through out the book  harry  at many points  feels very frustrated with dumbledore and the amount of secrets he kept from harry however he also comes to see that mostly when dumbledore was keeping secrets  it was as a benefit to harry it might not be something harry liked  but it was something he needed eventually  harry makes a decision to trust in dumbledore s judgement and sort of comes to accept that he can not always know everything and that sometimes he needs to not act  which is enormously hard for him   when he sees those memories  he does think about dumbledore s betrayal  but it feels to him as a minor thing against the knowledge that he has to die  gt  slowly  very slowly  he sat up  and as he did so he felt more alive and more aware of his own living body than ever before why had he never appreciated what a miracle he was  brain and nerve and bounding heart  it would all be gone    or at least  he would be gone from it his breath came slow and deep  and his mouth and throat were completely dry  but so were his eyes  gt  dumbledore  s betrayal was almost nothing of course there had been a bigger plan  harry had simply been too foolish to see it  he realized that now  the thing is that harry does see the sense of it he understands why dumbledore did what he did  and he understands why he is the one who has to die  and if it is him  then nobody else has to at this point  harry s emotions are a huge mess he is in a great state of shock and wanting to live but knowing he can not  so anger is not at the forefront of his brain eventually when he meets dumbledore  after being killed  by voldemort  the shock has worn off  but he is still mostly confused  which keeps him from feeling anger it also helps that pretty much one of the first things dumbledore tells him is that he is not exactly dead then dumbledore goes on to explain and apologises to harry  with tears in his eyes  which helps harry understand that everything dumbledore did  he did nt do for the funsies he made these decisions because they were the best ones  but they were nt easy or kind  not even on dumbledore himself  which is what helps harry come to peace with them  honestly  the books go way more in depth with harry s feelings re  dumbledore than anyone could ever do in a simple post  so i very much urge you to read them it will help clarify a lot  b when harry first finds out about the bully james was in the past  it actually bothers him a lot there is quite a chunk of the fifth book that deals with harry thinking about what he saw in the pensive and his father s behaviour he does quite a dangerous thing  using umbridge s fire to talk to sirius and lupin  just to get more information on his father s behaviour eventually he learns to give it a place he still loves his father  obviously  but he thinks of him with slightly less blind idealism still  from all accounts  it does seem like james  honestly  changed  and snape was nt exactly innocent in all of it either  james and snape pretty much continuously hexed each other  so it is not like james is an unrepenting douchebag either he s a person who made douchy choices as a teen  but also made a lot of good ones during that same time of his life  who eventually grew out of it  which is sort of how harry comes to remember him  c in the order of the phoenix  after christmas  sirius gives harry one of a pair of twoway mirrors but does nt explain them they are basically like mirror walkietalkies  that sirius and james used to use to talk to each other in detention harry  realising it is a way to contact sirius  fears that doing so will make sirius do something stupid and dangerous and puts them in the bottom of his trunk he forgets about them  even when he needs them most after sirius s death  harry remembers the mirror  however because sirius is dead  he can not use them anymore still  he does nt get rid of it it eventually shatters  but harry keeps the biggest piece the second mirror  the one that belonged to sirius is found by mundungus when he is looting sirius s house for stuff to sell he sells that mirror to aberforth  dumbledore s brother  who realises what is aberforth uses the mirror to keep an eye on harry  it is his blue eye harry sees  and eventually uses it to send dobby to them when they are in great danger  d snape loved lily snape has never loved anyone but lily lily cared great for him  as a friend  and potentially more according to jkr  but the path snape put himself on  the one with the dark arts  turned her away from him it all came to a head when snape called her a mudblood lily ended their friendship there  but snape did nt stop loving her because he loved her  he tried to ask voldemort to spare her  and through that  gave lily an out  which she refused to take but instead protected her son   knowing that snape loved lily so much  dumbledore used that love to get snape on their side when dumbledore asks if snape s feeling are still the same after all this time  snape casts that patronus  lily s patronus had been a doe as well  and tell him  yes  always he s still in this for lily ",

        "text": "i m personally not a huge fan of hiphop i mostly listen to metal  stuff like opeth  meshuggah  born of osiris  etc that said  i can appreciate talent and passion in other genres as well  which has led me to develop a taste for tech n9ne  tupac  and dre  i decided to give to pimp a butterfly a listen on the suggestion of a friend  and i ve been completely blown away it s my favorite album right now  i ca nt stop listening to it i m a big fan of jazz  so i love all the jazz elements he s using i think as a technical rapper  he s not quite at tech n9ne or eminem s level  but he s close what sets him apart  in my mind  is his lyrics they re pure poetry there are so many hidden meanings you have to figure out he does nt always spell out what he s saying  you have to piece it together  the entire album comes together into this powerful narrative about the institutionalizing of blacks in america a lot of what he talks about are well known topics  like the cia attempts to undermine the black community by distributing crack cocaine and setting gangs on each other it reminded me of tupac s lyric   give em guns  watch em kill each other  it s a fact that the prison population in the us is overwhelmingly black even if we assume that it s that way because blacks commit more crime  and not just because the judicial system is harder on them   then you have to understand that it s not because of their race  it s because the lower socioeconomic levels in this country are predominantly occupied by blacks when people are dirt poor  they sometimes become more desperate to pull themselves out of poverty  and are willing to commit crimes to do so and when there is an institutionalized pressure keeping a specific group in the lower class from rising  that group might go to even more drastic means to break through  you then have to ask yourself   why would the institution  target blacks like this   the answer is another major theme kendrick touches on in the album there are still a lot of really racist people out there who genuinely hate black people and view them as subhuman you would think opinions like these would be gone in our enlightened age  but they still flourish people are just less open about it  generally i ve dated a couple black girls in the past  and i honestly could nt believe some of the things that happen to them being stopped by police for no apparent reason people refusing them service  or customers at their place of work requesting a white person help them i would nt have believed it if i had nt seen it for myself multiple times and this is what the black community faces each and every day  so  what are they to do to overcome this systematic opposition  the answer is another major theme of the album  the black community needs to stop fighting amongst themselves and unify to improve their lot being a big tupac fan  this message really resonated with me  as this was a major theme of tupac s lyrics the album  i feel  leaves you with a feeling of hope  that this is something that is within reach  just to specify  i am a white male born into a middle class family  but kendrick s message really opened my eyes to what black america experiences every day and i think that was his real goal  not only does he want to sound a rally cry for the black community to unite  but he wants to open the eyes of the white community  and make them see that there is still a problem with systematic and institutionalized racism in america that needs to be addressed so  i love this album for the great music  production  and rapping  but i think it will go down as an alltime great because of the powerful message in contains hopefully that was helpful to you ",
